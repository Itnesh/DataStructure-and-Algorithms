# It's use to calculate the rum time and space comlexity of any code
# Rule 1: Any assignment and if statement has constant time comlexity. i.e o(1)
# Rule 2: Any for loop withought any nested loop time complexity is linear. i.e o(n)
# Rule 3: Any nested loop has time complexity is quadrilateral . i.e o(2^n)
# Rule 4: for multiple statement we just simple adding
# Lets see the top 10 question

def operation(array):
    sum=0 -----------O(1)
    product=1 -------O(1)
    
    for i in array: --O(n)
        sum+=i -------O(1)
    for i in array: --O(n)
        product*=i ---O(1)
    print(f"Sum {sum} product {product}")--O(1)

so Time complexity = O(n)

by the method of constant removal so 2 O(n)~O(n) and constant removed just its so short in front of O(n)
