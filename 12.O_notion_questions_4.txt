def printUnorderPair(arrayA,arrayB):
    for i in arrayA:
        for j in arrayB:
            if arrayA[i]<arrayB[j]:
                print(str(arrayA[i])+","+arrayB[j])

lets consider the element in arrayA is n and in arrayB element is m
{not n^2 just because of its two different array so its msut be O(n) and O(m)}
then, Now Time complexity =O(nm) 

Note: Its not any quadratic time complexity(quadratic time complexity is O(n^2))
